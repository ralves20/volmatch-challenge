Automation Using Java

## The Challenge Details

1. Open Google homepage using Selenium
2. Enter the search "Weather in a selected location" in the search bar
3. Submit the search and wait for the results page to load
4. Extract the Temperature in the selected location from the results and store the value in an object
5. Make a call to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the same specific location and deserialize the result into an object
6. Print the temperature difference between the results in 4 and 5

# 1. THE PROJECT

Below are described the details of the project, of what tools and lib were used, how to setup it, how to run and some additional info.

## 1.1. Description of the project
_"The Screenplay Pattern is a user-centered approach to writing high-quality automated acceptance tests. It steers you towards an effective use of layers of abstraction, helps your tests capture the business vernacular, and encourages good testing and software engineering habits. Instead of focusing on low-level, interface-centric interactions, you describe your test scenarios in a similar way you'd describe them to a human being - an actor in Screenplay-speak. You write simple, readable and highly-reusable code that instructs the actors what activities to perform and what things to check. The domain-specific test language you create is used to express screenplays - the activities for the actors to perform in a given test scenario. The Screenplay Pattern is one of the core design patterns behind Serenity/JS and in this chapter we'll look into how to apply it in practice."_

```

## 2. RUNNING THE TESTS

### 2.1. Execution of the tests

```
mvn clean verify (Run all tests)
```


### 2.2. Test Report
After the test execution the reports (which also have screenshots) will be generated in the `target/site/serenity` directory, then you can see the report by just opening the `index.html` file
